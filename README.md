### Project Summary
Checkers is a board game, one of the worldâ€™s oldest classic games which are played by two persons who oppose each other across a board of 64 light and dark squares. The goal is to jump the opponent's pieces, and remove them from the board, in an effort to win back one's players and remove every opposing piece from the board. It has been known that the simple game of checkers can provide significant training in thought and logic, develop concentration skills, and boost problem-solving skills. Of course, it also keeps players occupied with fun competition.

Checkers AI will focus on optimizing already existing algorithms, minimax, and alpha pruning, and also coming up with different heuristics to improve our performance. After doing that, we will look into where this can be implemented to solve the real-world problems Ethiopia has. This has benefits that it could be tailored to apply in many similar reinforced AI applications directly or indirectly. We will be trying out efficient and effective algorithms to create a checkers playing agent. the system can implement the function of intelligent and optimal decision-making. We hope our final finding contributes a lot to the intelligent decision-making theory and the application of its algorithms on computer games technology and real-world reinforced AI applications.

### How to run the project
After navigating to the folder that contains the Checkers_Workshop_GUI.jar, you should run the following command : java -jar Checkers_Workshop_GUI.jar <br />
If successful, you should see the following window pop-up.
